# Running in Kubernetes with interpolated secrets
Microservices built on top of Liquid Application Framework, when running in Kubernetes pods automatically look for a secret called server-secret having sensitive key and connection information to access underlying services such as database, storage, message bus, autentication, etc.

# Define keys in json settings as <YOUR_KEY_SOMETHING>
By defining a value of a key in microservice's json settings ,the framework look in the server secret file to interpolate keys and values.

Therefore, no sensitive runtime information is needed to be stored along with the source code of microservices.
